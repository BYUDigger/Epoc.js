# JavaScript framework for the Emotiv EPOC [WIP]

This framework provides an interface to access data from the Emotiv EPOC brain sensor using Node.js.

To use this framework, you're gonna need an EPOC / EPOC+ or Insight that you can buy [here](https://emotiv.com/).

Originally based on the [epocutils library](http://stephaneag.github.io/epocutils/) by [@StephaneAG](https://github.com/stephaneAG)

## Status:

* **Refactored to use latest SDK â€“ Working with EmoComposer but still need to test while wearing the sensor.**

* Known issues:
  * Cognitive Actions are not working at the moment when wearing the sensor.
  * Need to provide a way for users to provide the path to their own user data file when launching the program.

## How to Install

* Download the **Emotiv Community SDK v3.4.0** [here](https://github.com/Emotiv/community-sdk/releases) and copy the `edk.framework` file (community-sdk > lib > Mac > edk.framework) to `/Library/Frameworks` (on Mac).

*The latest version of the SDK at the moment is 3.5.0 but it is not entirely compatible with this framework.*

* Either clone this repo and run

```
  npm install
```
or just run:

```
  npm install epocjs
```

## Run the example code

If you just want to test that the framework is working, you can run:

```
  node example/controls.js
```


## How to Use

Example of simple program:

```
  var Epoc = require('epocjs')();

  Epoc.connect(function(event){
    if(event.smile > 0){
      console.log('smiling')
    }
  })
```

## Events

---

#### Smile

If the value is superior to 0, the headset is detecting that the user is smiling.

```
  if(event.smile > 0){
    // do something
  }
```

---

#### Looking Up / Down / Left / Right

The headset can detect the direction in which the user is looking:

```
  if(event.lookingUp > 0){
    // do something
  }

  if(event.lookingDown > 0){
    // do something
  }

  if(event.lookingLeft > 0){
    // do something
  }

  if(event.lookingRight > 0){
    // do something
  }
```

---

#### Blink

Detect if the user blinked:

```
  if(event.blink > 0){
    // do something
  }
```

---

#### Winking Left / Right

The headset can detect if the user is winking:

```
  if(event.winkingLeft > 0){
    // do something
  }

  if(event.winkingRight > 0){
    // do something
  }
```

---

#### Laugh

Detect if the user is laughing:

```
  if(event.laugh > 0){
    // do something
  }
```

---

#### Gyroscope

Detect changes in gyroscope data:

```
  if(event.gyroX){
    // do something
  }

  if(event.gyroX){
    // do something
  }
```

---


#### Cognitive Actions (Only working with the EmoComposer at the moment)

Actions available:

- push
- pull
- lift
- drop
- left
- right
- rotate left
- rotate right
- rotate clockwise
- rotate counter clockwise
- rotate reverse
- disappear

```
  switch(cognitivAction){
    case 2:
      console.log('push')
      break;
    case 4:
      console.log('pull')
      break;
    case 8:
      console.log('lift')
      break;
    case 16:
      console.log('drop')
      break;
    case 32:
      console.log('left')
      break;
    case 64:
      console.log('right')
      break;
    case 128:
      console.log('rotate left')
      break;
    case 256:
      console.log('rotate right')
      break;
    case 512:
      console.log('rotate clockwise')
      break;
    case 1024:
      console.log('rotate counter clockwise')
      break;
    case 2048:
      console.log('rotate forwards')
      break;
    case 4096:
      console.log('rotate reverse')
    case 8192:
      console.log('disappear')
  }

```
